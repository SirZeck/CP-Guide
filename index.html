				The core directive in ‘Competitive Programming’ is this: “Given well-known Computer
				Science (CS) problems, solve them as quickly as possible!”.
				Let’s digest the terms one by one. The term ‘well-known CS problems’ implies that in
				competitive programming, we are dealing with solved CS problems and not research problems
				(where the solutions are still unknown). Some people (at least the problem author) have
				definitely solved these problems before. To ‘solve them’ implies that we must push our CS
				knowledge to a certain required level so that we can produce working code that can solve
				these problems too—at least in terms of getting the same output as the problem author
				using the problem author’s secret test data within the stipulated time limit. The need to
				solve the problem ‘as quickly as possible’ is where the competitive element lies—speed is a
				very natural goal in human behavior.

			<li><h2> Important Competitive Programming Contests </h2></li>

			<div class="box2">
				<ul> 
					<li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest" target = "_blank"> ACM International_Collegiate_Programming_Contest </a></li>
					<P>The International Collegiate Programming Contest, known as the ICPC, is an annual multi-tiered competitive programming competition among the universities of the world.</P>
					<li><a href = "https://ioinformatics.org/" target = "_blank"> International Olympiad in Informatics </a></li>
					<p>The IOI is one of five international science olympiads. The primary goal of the IOI is to stimulate interest in informatics (computing science) and information technology.</p>
					<li><a href = "https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam" target = "_blank"> Google CodeJam </a></li>
					<p>Code Jam is Google's longest running global coding competition, where programmers of all levels put their skills to the test. Competitors work their way through a series of online algorithmic puzzles to earn a spot at the World Finals, all for a chance to win the championship title and $15,000.</p>
					<li><a href = "https://www.facebook.com/codingcompetitions/hacker-cup" target = "_blank"> FaceBook Hacker Cup </a></li>
					<p>Hacker Cup is Facebook's annual open programming competition. Open to participants around the world, we invite you to apply problem-solving and algorithmic coding skills to advance through each year’s online rounds, win prizes, and have a chance to make it to the global finals and win the grand prize.</p>
					<li><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topcoder_Open" target = "_blank"> Topcoder_Open </a></li>
					<p>Topcoder Open (TCO) is an annual design, software development, data science and competitive programming championship, organized by Topcoder, and hosted in different venues around US.</p>

			<li><h2> Contest Sites </h2></li>

			<div class="box3">
				<ul>
					<li><a href = "https://codeforces.com/" target = "_blank"> CodeForces </a></li>
					<p>Codeforces is one of the most famous online judges in the world. Currently, there are
						7000+ problems.</p>
					<li><a href = "https://atcoder.jp/home" target = "_blank"> AtCoder </a></li>
					<p>AtCoder is a contest site that there are many good problems. It is only “my opinion”, but
						if you want to be better, you should solve AtCoder.</p>
					<li><a href = "https://www.codechef.com/" target = "_blank"> CodeChef </a></li>
					<p>CodeChef is also a good platform to practice your CP skills.</p>
					<li><a href = "https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart" target = "_blank"> Google KickStart </a></li>
					<p>Kick Start is a global online coding competition, consisting of three-hour rounds of a variety of algorithmic challenges designed by Google engineers.</p>
